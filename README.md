# Image-Deformation

This project attempted to implement a two-dimensional Image Distortion function using OpenGL based on the C++ language, and aims to create Interactive Image Deformation haing high DOF.

## Goal
- High DOF User Interactive Program
- Local Deformation Parallel Calculation

## Local Deformation
- Vector magnitude
- Vector direction
